    "\n",
    "1. **Making Changes**: Edit your files as normal in VS Code\n",

    "\n",
    "Important: Just saving your file (which happens automatically in the Codespace, or manually with `Ctrl+S`) only saves it to disk - it doesn't create a snapshot in Git! You need to **stage** and **commit** to save a version in Git."
